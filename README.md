# Contact Management System

A contact management system utilising a custom HTTP server, plain-old javascript code, and a custom text-based database for storing contact information.

## Purpose

This project was developed without using Javascript frameworks such as React.js or Express.js which simplify the development of web applications.

The project helped me learn the internal workings of HTTP servers and manual DOM updation using vanilla Javascript, giving me a deeper understanding of web-development which aids me with efficient coding and seamless debugging.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Javascript
- HTML
- Bootstrap CSS

## Run locally

The project requires,

- Node.js

Execute the project locally,

- Cloning the repo
- Running the HTTP server written in `server.js` as follows

``` terminal
node server.js
```

By default, the project runs on `locahost:8080`
To run it on a different port, change the port variable defined on line 5 of `server.js` to the desired port
